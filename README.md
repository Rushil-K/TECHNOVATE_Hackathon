# Visionary Vortex - TECHNOVATE Hackathon - Hospital Management System

**Team Members:** Khushi Kalra, Rushil Kohli, Radhika Sarin, Swati Kaushik, Mohit Vaidya

This repository documents our work as Team Visionary Vortex during the TECHNOVATE Hackathon at FORE School of Management. We developed prototypes for a Hospital Management System, which was awarded the 1st Prize in the competition.

## Project Goal

Our objective was to design and prototype key modules of a Hospital Management System to address challenges in efficiency, resource management, and patient flow within a hospital environment.

## Prototypes Developed

We focused on creating individual prototypes for the following critical functionalities:

* **`Bed_Availability_System.ipynb`:** A prototype for tracking and managing the availability of beds within the hospital. This aimed to provide a real-time view of bed occupancy and facilitate efficient patient allocation.
* **`Inventory_Management_System.ipynb`:** A prototype for managing the hospital's inventory of medical supplies and equipment. The goal was to prevent shortages, optimize stock levels, and ensure timely availability of necessary resources.
* **`Medicines_Availability_System.ipynb`:** A prototype focused on tracking the availability of medicines within the hospital pharmacy. This aimed to streamline medicine dispensing and manage pharmaceutical stock effectively.
* **`Patients_Queue_System.ipynb`:** A prototype designed to manage patient queues in various hospital departments. The objective was to reduce waiting times, improve patient flow, and enhance the overall patient experience.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook files for each of our prototypes:

* `Bed_Availability_System.ipynb`
* `Inventory_Management_System.ipynb`
* `Medicines_Availability_System.ipynb`
* `Patients_Queue_System.ipynb`

Each notebook contains the code, explanations, and any simulated data used to demonstrate the functionality of the respective system.

## Our Journey and Learnings

Participating in the TECHNOVATE Hackathon and developing these prototypes was an intensive and rewarding experience. Some of our key takeaways include:

* Successfully conceptualizing and prototyping solutions for real-world hospital management challenges within a limited timeframe.
* Gaining practical experience in applying our technical skills to address operational inefficiencies.
* Learning the importance of modular design and focusing on specific functionalities to build a larger system.
* Strengthening our collaboration and problem-solving abilities as a team.
* Achieving the **1st Prize** at the TECHNOVATE Hackathon, which was a testament to our hard work, innovative thinking, and effective teamwork.

## Next Steps (Internal Reflection)

Moving forward, we can consider the following steps to further develop our ideas:

* Exploring the integration of these individual prototypes into a more comprehensive system.
* Investigating the use of different technologies and frameworks for building a more robust and scalable solution.
* Considering the development of user interfaces for easier interaction with the systems.
* Researching the potential for incorporating more advanced features and data analytics.

This repository serves as a record of our efforts and achievements during the TECHNOVATE Hackathon. We are proud of what we accomplished as Team Visionary Vortex.
